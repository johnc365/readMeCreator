# readMeCreator
## Description

This is a program that can be run on the command line using node that generates a README.md file quickly and efficently by simply answering prompts. Its purpose is to make the process of creating a README.md file just a little simpler and more efficient. The program is written in javascript to run in node and uses the npm Inquirer package.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

In order to install this project, you will need node installed on your computer. Then you can simply use the GitHub link provided at the bottom of this page to navigate to my GitHub repository where you can access the code to copy or download the program file.

## Usage

You will need node to use this program. If you do not have node installed on your computer, install it now. Once you have node, you can open your terminal and navigate to the directory in which the index.js file is stored. Then, type "node index.js" into the command line. This will initiate a set of prompts in the command line that. The answers you provide will make up the text of your README.md file. Once you have answered all of the questions, a new file called "sampleReadMe.md" will appear in the directory, built with all of the information you provided in the prompts. If you run the index.js file in node again, it will overwrite the generated file with the most recent data provided to the program. For further usage clarification, watch the video [here]().
